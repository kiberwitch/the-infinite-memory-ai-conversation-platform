An AI companion with infinite memory that never forgets your context


### Pollinates AI with memory: goal - preserving the context for better interaction

This is an interface for communication with AI, which ** preserves important information forever **. Your goal is to create a personalized assistant who remembers everything that you consider important.

### How the memory system works:

1. ** Memory is a context.
** All the information that you save in the "Constant Memory" section is transmitted by AI at each of your request.

2. ** Your data is saved. ** Memory is automatically preserved in your browser (`localstorage`). At the next visit, AI will remember everything that you told him.

3. ** Full control. ** You can add,
View and delete notes from memory at any time. Purification of memory completely erases the entire accumulated context.

###H that allows you to create a personalized assistant:

*** Personal preferences: ** inform AI about your interests, communication style or specific requirements.
*** The context of the conversation: ** Save important details of the current discussion so that AI is always aware.
*** Specific knowledge: ** Add specialized information that AI should take into account when answers.
*** The history of interactions: ** Remember the key points of previous conversations for the continuity of dialogue.
** Your strategy: ** regularly add important information to the memory, purify outdated data and use the context to obtain more relevant answers. Your reward is AI, which over time understands you better and better.
